# Desktop Voice Assistant using GUI-Actor and Whisper

This repository contains a **Voice-Controlled Desktop Assistant** prototype that leverages:

- Microsoft's **GUI-Actor** for GUI interactions
- **Whisper Model** for speech recognition

---

## 🚀 Features

- Voice command interpretation using Whisper
- Controls desktop GUI applications via GUI-Actor
- Fully Python-based and modular
- Installation commands are integrated within the notebook itself

---

## 📋 Requirements

- A **Linux-based environment** (tested on Ubuntu)
- Alternatively, you can run it on:
  - **Google Colab**
  - **Kaggle Notebooks**

> **⚠️ Note:** Some features (like GUI interactions with `pyautogui`) might not work on Colab/Kaggle since they require desktop access. Full functionality is achievable on local Linux systems.

### Python Libraries

If you prefer setting up a local Python environment, install dependencies via:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
